\usage{
\method{plot}{Maf}(maf.obj, smoothSpan = 0.3, cexVal = 2,
  nmaf = min(dim(maf.obj$x)[2], 3), plotUncertainty = TRUE, B = 100,
  alpha = 0.05, blockSize = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{smoothSpan}{Fraction between 0-1 that specifies the proportion of timesteps
to include in the smoothing window, which is weighted by a tricubic. See ?loess for
details. Alternatively, one can specify an integer greater than 1 which refers to the 
number of time points to include in the tricubic filter.}

\item{cexVal}{The size of the labels in the plot}

\item{nmaf}{The number of MAFs to plot}

\item{plotUncertainty}{A logical specifying whether to plot the confidence interval
around each maf.}

\item{B}{Number of replications in the confidence interval calculations}

\item{alpha}{The significance level}

\item{blockSize}{The block size of the resampled residuals, i.e. the number of 
contiguous time steps to sample at the time from the set of residuals.}

\item{mafObject}{The output of the \code{maf} function.}
}
\value{
A plot of the MAFs and a list containing 
\describe{
	\item{\code{pval}}{The p-values of each MAF, where the p-value refers to the number of 
resampled MAFs that have a higher empirical SNR than the original MAFs. If there are less
than \eqn{\alpha}, e.g. 0.05, resampled MAFs that have a higher empirical SNR than the
original MAF, the MAF in question is not significant.}
 \item{\code{statStar}}{ Empirical SNR for each resampled MAF time series, i.e. a p x B matrix 
 where p is the total number of predictors and B is the number of bootstraps/replications}
 \item{\code{statObs}}{ The empirical SNR of the original MAF time series.}
}
}
\description{
This function will plot the first few mafs in the dataset overlaid
with a smooth version of the same maf and, if desired, confidence intervals.
Additionally, an estimate of the number of mafs will be printed.
}
\details{
The confidence intervals are obtained using a resampling scheme which extracts the residuals of the original 
time series after smoothing
with the same filter as the one parametrized by \code{smoothSpan}. The residuals are 
bootstrapped or block bootstrapped (if there is temporal structure in the residuals)
and added back to the smooth, creating a new data set. From the new data set a new set of
MAFs are calculated.

The smoothing parameter \code{smoothSpan} is also used when calculating the empirical 
Signal-to-Noise ratio. Where we subtract the smooth from the time series and calculate
the variance of the smooth estimate over the residual variance. This gives an empirical
signal-to-noise estimate.
